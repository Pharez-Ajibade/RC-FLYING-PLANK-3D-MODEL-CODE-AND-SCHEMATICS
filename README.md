# RC-FLYING-PLANK-3D-MODEL-CODE-AND-SCHEMATICS
ELECTRONIC SCHEMATICS, CODE, AND 3D MODEL FOR AN RC FLYING PLANK

This repository contains the electronic schematics, code, and 3D models for an RC flying plank based on the KFM3 airfoil design. This project aims to provide the necessary resources for building and flying a lightweight, durable, and efficient remote-controlled flying plank.

Overview
This project is based on a flying plank design using the KFM3 (Kline-Fogleman Method 3) airfoil, known for its stability and efficient lift generation. The flying plank can be used for a variety of RC applications, including flight tests, fun flying, and experimentation.

The repository contains:
Electronic Schematics: Diagrams for the electrical components, including servos, ESCs, motors, and receivers.
Code: Firmware for the flight controller, which includes control logic for the flying plank.
3D Models: Models for designing the airframe and components

The main components required for this project are:

Motor: A brushless motor suitable for lightweight aircraft.

Electronic Speed Controller (ESC): To control the motor speed.

Servos: For controlling the control surfaces (elevons).

Flight Controller ( An Arduino microcontroller )

Radio Receiver: To communicate between the transmitter and flight controller.

Battery: A LiPo battery (suitable for the motor and ESC).

Propeller: A lightweight propeller for efficient thrust.

General Assembly Steps:

Build the airframe: 3D print or cut the airframe parts from foam, wood, or other lightweight materials.

Install the motor: Attach the motor to the motor mount and secure it to the airframe.

Connect the electronics: Wire the ESC, servos, and receiver to the flight controller.

Test and fly: Perform ground tests, check control surfaces, and conduct safe flight testing.
